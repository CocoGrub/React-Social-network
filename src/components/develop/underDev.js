                <p>Mozzarella is commonly used on pizza, with the highest quality buffalo mozzarella produced in the
                    surroundings of Naples.[38] Eventually, other cheeses were used well as pizza ingredients,
                    particularly Italian cheeses including provolone, pecorino romano, ricotta, and scamorza. Less
                    expensive processed cheeses or cheese analogues have been developed for mass-market pizzas to
                    produce desirable qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture
                    content, and stable shelf life. This quest to create the ideal and economical pizza cheese has
                    involved many studies and experiments analyzing the impact of vegetable oil, manufacturing and
                    culture processes, denatured whey proteins, and other changes in manufacture. In 1997, it was
                    estimated that annual production of pizza cheese was 1 million tonnes (1,100,000 short tons) in the
                    U.S. and 100,000 tonnes (110,000 short tons) in Europe.</p>
